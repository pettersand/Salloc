## Usage

### Setting Up Savings Posts and Allocations

1. **Create Savings Posts:** After signing up and logging in, navigate to the "Setup" section. Here, you can create customized savings posts such as "Vacation," "Education," "Emergency Fund," and more.

2. **Allocate Percentages:** Assign a specific percentage to each savings post based on your financial priorities. For example, you might allocate 30% to "Vacation," 20% to "Education," and 10% to "Emergency Fund."

3. **Initial Setup:** If you want to start with a clean slate and have all your savings initially set to "Emergency Fund", simply create one post with 100%, and commit the savings. From there you can easily add posts and allocation percentages for any future deposits. 

### Making Deposits and Withdrawals

1. **Record Deposits:** In the "Deposit Funds" section, enter the amount you wish to deposit. Salloc will automatically distribute the funds to each savings post according to the allocated percentages. Alternatively you may choose to deposit to a single post, or even move funds from one post to another. 

2. **Withdrawals:** When spending money devoted to any given post the user can first check if they have available funds. If so, they can make a specific withdrawal from that post ensuring their savings are up to date.

### Tracking Progress and Making Decisions

1. **Monitor Available Funds:** Check the available funds in each savings post on the dashboard. This will help you make informed decisions about your spending based on your budget for each category.

2. **Visualize Progress:** Navigate to the "Overview" section to visualize your progress toward your savings targets. Visual indicators and graphs provide a clear overview of your achievements.

### Adjusting Goals and Allocations

1. **Modify Goals:** If your financial goals change, you can easily adjust your savings targets for each post. Go to the "Overview" section and update the target amounts accordingly in the tables editable fields.

2. **Update Allocations:** Update the percentage allocations for your savings posts based on your changing priorities. These adjustments will be reflected in how Salloc distributes future deposits without affecting your current savings.

### Staying Motivated

1. **Celebrate Milestones:** As you reach your savings goals, celebrate your achievements! Salloc's progress tracking and notifications will keep you motivated and up to date throughout your financial journey.

2. **Treat Yourself:** When reaching your goals you can treat yourself with a clean conscience. No more insecurity about whether you can afford something or not.

## About

My name is Petter Sand Austnes. After 13 years as a strength coach and personal trainer I found love on a different path. Salloc is an improved implementation of an excel spreadsheet I had been using privately. And thus, my first project on my software development journey. I had been coding for just over 3 months at the launch of Salloc. So I assume it will only get better with time. I hope you will enjoy and find a use for this application, and that it may help you reach your savings goals!
